We go our own way here, getting out into the field to bring you news of the hidden gems that genuinely—as the IEEE motto goes—advance technology for the benefit of humanity.</p><p>A look back at the last 20 years of January issues reveals that while we’ve certainly covered our share of huge tech projects, like the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-last-first-light-for-the-james-webb-space-telescope\" target=\"_self\">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, many of the stories touch on subjects most people would have otherwise missed.</p><p>Last January, Senior Associate Editor Emily Waltz reported on startups that are piloting <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ocean-carbon-removal\" target=\"_self\">ocean-based carbon capture</a>. This issue, she’s back with another CO<span><sub>2</sub></span>-centric story, this time focused on grid-scale storage, which is poised to blow up—literally. Waltz traveled to Sardinia to check out Milan-based <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/co2-battery-energy-storage\" target=\"_blank\">Energy Dome’s “bubble battery,”</a> which can store up to 200 megawatt-hours by compressing and decompressing pure carbon dioxide inside an inflatable dome.</p><p>This kind of modular, easy-to-deploy energy storage could be especially useful for AI data centers, says Senior Editor <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/technology-forecast-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Samuel K. Moore</a>, who curated this issue and wrote about <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/gravity-energy-storage-will-show-its-potential-in-2021\" target=\"_self\">gravity energy storage</a> back in January 2021.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">Big bubbles could help with grid-scale storage; tiny bubbles can liquefy cancer tumors.</p><p> “When we think about energy storage, our minds usually go to grid-scale batteries,” Moore says. “Yet these bubbles, which are in many ways more capable than batteries, will be sprouting up all over the place, often in association with computing infrastructure.”</p><p>For his story in this issue, Moore dove into the competition between two startups that are developing <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/rf-over-fiber\" target=\"_blank\">radio-based cables to replace conventional copper cables and fiber optics in data centers</a>. These radio systems can connect processors 10 to 20 meters apart using a third of the power of optical-fiber cables and at a third of the cost. The next step is to integrate the radio connections directly with GPUs, to ease cooling burdens and help data centers and the AI models running on them continue to scale up.</p><p>Big bubbles could help with grid-scale storage; tiny bubbles can liquify cancer tumors, as Greg Uyeno found when reporting on <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ultrasound-cancer-treatment\" target=\"_blank\">HistoSonics’ ultrasound treatment</a>. Feared for its aggressive nature and extremely low survival rate, pancreatic cancer kills <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9476884/#:~:text=Core%20tip:%20Pancreatic%20cancer%2C%20as,critical%20for%20global%20cancer%20control.\" target=\"_blank\">almost half a million people</a> per year worldwide. <a href=\"https://histosonics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HistoSonics</a> uses noninvasive, focused ultrasound to create cavitation bubbles that destroy tumors without dangerously heating surrounding tissue. This year, the company is concluding kidney trials as well as launching pancreatic cancer trials.</p><p>Over the last two decades, <em><em>Spectrum</em></em> has regularly covered the rise of drones. In 2018, for instance, we reported that the startup <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/zipline-expands-its-medical-delivery-drones-across-east-africa\" target=\"_self\">Zipline would deploy autonomous drones</a> to deliver blood and medical supplies in rural Rwanda. Today, <a href=\"https://www.zipline.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zipline</a> has a market cap of about US $4 billion and operates in several African countries, Japan, and the United States, having completed almost 2 million drone deliveries. In this issue, journalist Robb Mandelbaum takes us inside the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/wildfire-drones\" target=\"_blank\">Wildfire XPrize competition</a>, aimed at providing another life-saving service: dousing wildfires before they grow out of control. Zipline succeeded because it could make deliveries to remote locations much faster than land vehicles. This year’s XPrize teams plan to detect and suppress fires faster than conventional firefighting methods.</p><p>In addition to these emerging technologies, we’ve packed this issue with a dozen others, including <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/porsche-wireless-ev-charging\" target=\"_blank\">Porsche’s wireless home charger for EVs</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/joby-air-taxi\" target=\"_blank\">the world’s first electric air taxi service</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/neutral-atom-quantum-computing\" target=\"_blank\">neutral-atom quantum computers</a>, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/mesh-network-interoperable-thread\" target=\"_blank\">interoperable mesh networks</a>, and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/11-amazing-engineering-events-in-2026\" target=\"_blank\">robotic baseball umpires</a>. Let’s see which of this year’s picks make it to the big leagues.</p>",

The robots’ job was to find victims and estimate the severity of their injuries, with the goal of <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-doctor\" target=\"_blank\">helping human medics</a> get to the people who need them the most.</p><h3>Kimberly Elenberg</h3><br /><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberly-elenberg-0b52a595\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kimberly Elenberg</a> is a principal project scientist with the <a href=\"https://autonlab.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Auton Lab</a> of Carnegie Mellon University’s Robotics Institute. Before joining CMU, Elenberg spent 28 years as an army and U.S. Public Health Service nurse, which included 19 deployments and serving as the principal strategist for incident response at the Pentagon.</p><p>The final event of the <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/research/challenges/darpa-triage-challenge\" target=\"_blank\">DARPA Triage Challenge</a> will take place in November, and <a href=\"https://teamchiron.ai/tabs/team/team.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Team Chiron</a> from <a href=\"https://www.cmu.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Carnegie Mellon University</a> will be competing, using a squad of quadruped robots and drones. The team is led by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberly-elenberg-0b52a595\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Kimberly Elenberg</a>, whose 28-year career as an army and <a href=\"https://www.usphs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Public Health Service</a> nurse took her from combat surgical teams to incident response strategy at the Pentagon.</p><p><strong>Why do we need robots for triage?</strong></p><p><strong>Kimberly Elenberg:</strong> We simply do not have enough responders for mass-casualty incidents. The drones and ground robots that we’re developing can give us the perspective that we need to identify where people are, assess who’s most at risk, and figure out how responders can get to them most efficiently.</p><p><strong>When could you have used robots like these?</strong></p><p><strong>Elenberg: </strong>On the way to one of the challenge events, there was a four-car accident on a back road. For me on my own, that was a mass-casualty event. I could hear some people yelling and see others walking around, and so I was able to reason that those people could breathe and move.</p><p>In the fourth car, I had to crawl inside to reach a gentleman who was slumped over with an occluded airway. I was able to lift his head until I could hear him breathing. I could see that he was hemorrhaging and feel that he was going into shock because his skin was cold. A robot couldn’t have gotten inside of the car to make those assessments.</p><p>This challenge involves enabling robots to remotely collect this data—can they detect heart rate from changes in skin color or hear breathing from a distance? If I’d had these capabilities, it would have helped me identify the person at greatest risk and gotten to them first.</p><p><strong>How do you design tech for triage?</strong></p><p><strong>Elenberg: </strong>The system has to be simple. For example, I can’t have a device that’s going to force a medic to take their hands away from their patient. What we came up with is a vest-mounted Android phone that flips down at chest height to display a map that has the GPS location of all of the casualties on it and their triage priority as colored dots, autonomously populated from the team of robots.</p><p><strong>Are the robots living up to the hype?</strong></p><p><strong>Elenberg: </strong>From my time in service, I know the only way to understand true capability is to build it, test it, and break it. With this challenge, I’m learning through end-to-end systems integration—sensing, communications, autonomy, and field testing in real environments. This is art and science coming together, and while the technology still has limitations, the pace of progress is extraordinary.</p><p><strong>What would be a win for you?</strong></p><p><strong>Elenberg:</strong> I already feel like we’ve won. Showing responders exactly where casualties are and estimating who needs attention most—that’s a huge step forward for disaster medicine. The next milestone is recognizing specific injury patterns and the likely life-saving interventions needed, but that will come.</p><p><em>This article appears in the January 2026 print issue as “Kimberly Elenberg.”</em><br /></p>",

Uber’s well-funded Elevate initiative, which included<a href=\"https://evtol.news/__media/PDFs/UberElevateWhitePaperOct2016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> a white paper</a> and three high-profile annual summits, effectively launched the electric vertical take-off and landing<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-aircraft\" target=\"_self\"> (eVTOL) industry</a>, promising investors, regulators, and the general public that these futuristic flying taxis were “<a href=\"https://youtu.be/JuWOUEFB_IQ\" target=\"_blank\">closer than you think</a>.”</p><p>At the time, California-based<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Joby Aviation</a> was still in stealth mode. But behind the scenes, this pioneering eVTOL developer—which has received more than US $3 billion in total funding, including<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/toyota-to-invest-500-million-in-joby-aviation/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> around $900 million from Toyota</a>—was playing a major role in shaping Uber’s vision. It later stepped in to keep that vision alive,<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-aviation-welcomes-new-75m-investment-from-uber-as-it-acquires-uber-elevate-and-expands-partnership/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> acquiring the Elevate program</a> in 2020 after Uber CEO<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_Khosrowshahi\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Dara Khosrowshahi</a> decided to axe it.</p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"joby\">Now, Joby, which was founded in 2009 and has become the dominant eVTOL startup, says it is finally on the verge of making “urban air mobility” a reality. It plans to conduct its first passenger flights in 2026 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tech 2026</a>.</p></div><p>“Dubai continues to be our global launchpad for commercial service, and our progress here is a testament to the UAE’s visionary approach to advanced air mobility,” says<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/antokho/?originalSubdomain=ae\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Anthony Khoury</a>, Joby’s UAE general manager, in an email interview. “Dubai is on track to be the first city in the world to offer a fully integrated, premium air taxi network, and we are sprinting toward that target.”</p><h2>Joby Struck a Six-Year Exclusive Deal with Dubai</h2><p>The company first <a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-to-launch-air-taxi-service-uae/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced its UAE plans</a> at the World Governments Summit in Dubai in February 2024, striking a deal with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) that gives it an exclusive right to operate air taxis there for six years from the launch of commercial operations.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\"><span>Joby’s exclusive Dubai deal will help fortify its lead in the global race to commercialize electric air taxis </span></p><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"agreement\">Joby also signed an agreement with U.K.-based<a href=\"https://skyports.net/\" target=\"_blank\"> Skyports</a> to design, build, and operate four “<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/evtol-2661135407\" target=\"_blank\">vertiport</a>” sites in Dubai—places for the eVTOL aircraft to load and unload passengers and charge their batteries. The first vertiport will be near Dubai International Airport, with additional ones planned for Dubai Mall, the Atlantis the Royal resort, and American University in Dubai.</p><p>Joby won’t be the first eVTOL developer to carry passengers. That distinction goes to China’s EHang, which is already conducting limited sightseeing and<a href=\"https://www.ehang.com/news/1275.html\" target=\"_blank\"> demonstration flights</a> with its two-seat, autonomous electric multicopters. (Joby’s aircraft are piloted.) If Joby pulls off its goal, however, it will be the first to routinely fly passengers from point to point over urban traffic, in keeping with Uber Elevate’s original vision. Its exclusive agreement in Dubai will help fortify its lead in the global race to commercialize electric air taxis, which includes a handful of other Western eVTOL developers, plus a growing number of Chinese players. Besides its Dubai deal, Joby also has a partnership with Delta to start an airport shuttle service in the United States.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A futuristic-looking electric rotorcraft is seen flying in a blue sky.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b31d3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-futuristic-looking-electric-rotorcraft-is-seen-flying-in-a-blue-sky.jpg?id=62599883&amp;width=980\" /><small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Joby S4 electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft has six electric motors, each weighing 28 kilograms and capable of a peak output of 236 kilowatts.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Joby Aviation</small></p><p>Operating a reliable air taxi service is a demanding proposition that will require Joby’s aircraft, charging infrastructure, and scheduling software to perform safely and reliably day in and day out. Since every new and complex technology has teething problems, Joby envisions fairly limited initial operations in 2026.</p><p>“We will transition from test flights to more complex proving runs and eventually nonpaying passenger flights out of the completed vertiports, ensuring a seamless passenger experience ahead of full commercial launch,” says Khoury. He adds that Joby is currently working with Skyports to ready its initial vertiports and with government agencies in Dubai and the UAE to receive the necessary approvals for its operations.</p><p>“Dubai’s approach is deeper and more comprehensive than what you see in many of the headlines,” said Clint Harper, an aviation infrastructure and policy advisor who recently participated in an advanced air mobility workshop with Dubai’s RTA. “In our workshop,” he says, “the RTA staff had fantastic questions and concerns regarding safety, security, and system-level integration. Everyone recognized and appreciated strong government support and wanted to deliver the right system solution, not just a one-off demo. I was thoroughly impressed and inspired.”</p><h2>Initial Air Operations Will Precede an Airworthiness Certificate</h2><p class=\"rm-anchors\" id=\"groundwork\">Notably, all of this groundwork is taking place in advance of Joby receiving an initial type certificate for its aircraft from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. In the United States (and elsewhere), a type certificate is typically a prerequisite for conducting commercial operations with paying passengers. Joby claims it’s making good progress toward FAA certification, but how quickly (or slowly) that process moves is largely out of its hands. In recent years, the FAA has been taking longer to certify even conventional airplanes and helicopters, which the industry blames on staffing shortages at the agency and more cautious decision-making in the wake of the<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/boeing-plea-737-max-crashes-b34daa014406657e720bec4a990dccf6\" target=\"_blank\"> Boeing 737 Max crisis</a>.</p><p>This perception that certification delays have more to do with bureaucracy than safety may be why Dubai is willing to approve some early operations by Joby in advance of FAA type certification. Interestingly, the United States is now following the UAE’s example. In September, the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation began soliciting proposals for an<a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/newsroom/trumps-transportation-secretary-sean-p-duffy-unveils-new-plan-fast-track-advanced-air\" target=\"_blank\"> eVTOL Integration Pilot Program</a> (eIPP), which will select at least five projects to demonstrate eVTOL operations in the national airspace starting as early as summer 2026.</p><p>The FAA has<a href=\"https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-policy/trump-executive-order-drones-will-shape-us-evtol-roll-out/\" target=\"_blank\"> stated</a> that the eIPP won’t allow eVTOL developers to bypass certification requirements or carry paying passengers. However, it will enable them to undertake additional testing and demonstration flights as a stepping-stone to commercial operations. Joby says it’s<a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-plans-to-jumpstart-us-operations-through-eipp/\" target=\"_blank\"> planning to take part</a> in the eIPP, meaning its air taxis could also be flying over U.S. cities in 2026—even if the only person on board is the pilot.</p>",

But this year, I’m not so sure. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-robotics-stories-2024\" target=\"_self\">At the end of 2024</a>, it really seemed like AI and humanoid robots were poised to make a transformative amount of progress toward some sort of practicality. While it’s certainly true that progress has been made, it’s hard to rationalize what’s actually happened in 2025 with the amount of money and hype that has suffused robotics over the course of the year. And for better or worse, humanoids are overshadowing everything else, raising questions about what will happen if the companies building them ultimately do not succeed.</p><p>We’ll be going into 2026 with both optimism and skepticism, and we’ll keep doing what we always do: talking to the experts, asking as many hard questions as we can, and making sure to share <em><em>all </em></em>the cool robots, even (or especially) the ones that you won’t see anywhere else.</p><p>So thanks for reading, and to all you awesome robotics folks out there, thanks for sharing your work with us! <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> has a bunch of exciting new stuff planned for 2026, and as we close out 2025, here’s a quick look back at some of our best robotics stories of the year.</p><h2>1. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/humanoid-robot-scaling\" target=\"_blank\">Reality Is Ruining the Humanoid Robot Hype</a><br /></h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"Robots with shovels stand in a container, ready for deployment on a pallet.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"36655\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/robots-with-shovels-stand-in-a-container-ready-for-deployment-on-a-pallet.jpg?id=61564898&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"> Eddie Guy </small> </p><p>Humanoid robots are hard, and they’re hard in lots of different ways. For some of those ways, we at least understand the problems and what the solutions will likely involve. But there are other problems that have no clear solutions, and most humanoid companies, especially the well-funded ones, seem <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/humanoid-robot-scaling\" target=\"_blank\">quite happy to wave those problems away</a> while continuing to raise extraordinary amounts of money. We’re going to keep calling this out whenever we see it, and expect even more skepticism in 2026.</p><h2>2. <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/unitree-robot-exploit\" target=\"_blank\">Exploit Allows for Takeover of Fleets of Unitree Robots</a><br /></h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"The Unitree humanoid robot with sleek design, dual-arm, and sensor-equipped head.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6b892\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/the-unitree-humanoid-robot-with-sleek-design-dual-arm-and-sensor-equipped-head.jpg?id=61646485&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"> CFOTO/Future Publishing/Getty Images </small> </p><p>Security is one of those pesky little things that is super important in robotics but that early-stage robotics companies typically treat as an afterthought because it doesn’t drive investment.

A large black quadcopter drone, more than two meters spanning the propeller tips, sat parked on the grass. Nestled between the legs of its landing gear was a red balloon filled with water. Not far away, on a concrete pad, a stack of wood pallets was ablaze, the flames whipping around in a heavy wind.

The drone needed to hover at about 13.5 meters overhead, and the balloon was configured to detonate at a specific point in midair to ensure optimal water dispersal, as calculated by UMD’s <a href=\"https://fpe.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Fire Protection Engineering</a>.

As a second, smaller drone outfitted with a thermal camera surveyed the scene from above, Rivas maneuvered the balloon-laden drone to the proper position. After about a half minute, he released the water bomb...and the balloon plummeted to the ground just wide of the platform, bursting with a <em><em>thwaaaap</em></em>.</p><div class=\"ieee-sidebar-small\"><p>This article is part of our special report <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/special-reports/top-tech-2026\" target=\"_blank\">Top Tech 2026</a>.</p></div><p>On this warm but blustery day in mid-October, a team of about 20 UMD students and professors were gathered at a fire and rescue training center in La Plata, Md., to demonstrate the building blocks of what could be the future of wildfire fighting. They called their team <a href=\"https://crossfire.umd.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Crossfire</a>. Their guests were a handful of officials from the <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/\" target=\"_blank\">XPrize Foundation</a>, which has organized a pair of competitions to vastly speed up <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/competitions/wildfire\" target=\"_blank\">wildfire detection and suppression</a>. Twelve other teams are competing with Crossfire in the semifinals for the autonomous wildfire-suppression track of the competition. In the final round, to be held in June 2026, five of those teams will have to find a fire within 1,000 square kilometers of what XPrize calls “environmentally challenging” terrain and then navigate to and extinguish it, all within 10 minutes. The winner collects a US $3.5 million purse—and, hopefully, the world’s wildfire-fighting armies get a powerful new weapon for their arsenals.</p><h2>The Wildfire Problem<br /></h2><p>Wildfires are growing more severe and affecting more people worldwide. The November 2018 Camp Fire that burned down 620 square kilometers of Northern California, including most of the town of Paradise, was the most deadly and destructive in the state’s recorded history, and it sent <a href=\"https://www.pge.com/en.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pacific Gas and Electric</a>, the giant utility <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article230445554.html\" target=\"_blank\">responsible</a> for starting <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-an-australian-state-faced-devastation-from-gridsparked-wildfires\" target=\"_self\">the fire</a>, into bankruptcy. XPrize had long been based in the Los Angeles area, so that catastrophe was undoubtedly on the minds of its staffers when they formulated the competition in 2019. “This was just something that was really personal and close to a lot of the individuals at the organization,” says <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/people/andrea-santy\" target=\"_blank\">Andrea Santy</a>, program director for the wildfire competition. XPrize eventually organized a separate track of the competition to award $3.5 million for detecting small fires with satellites.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A woman in a blue jacket and red hat seen from behind.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3f6e3\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-woman-in-a-blue-jacket-and-red-hat-seen-from-behind.jpg?id=62599503&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Andrea Santy, one of the program managers from XPrize in charge of the wildfire competition, looks on during Crossfire’s trials.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p><p>Santy says XPrize’s competition designers met with more than 100 experts in the field, including fire scientists, agency officials, and technologists—“all the experts that you would want at the table were at the table.” Where their views aligned, Santy says, XPrize researchers detected the “core problems.” One of the most important was response time. In the best case, an hour can often pass between when a fire is first detected and when it’s extinguished. XPrize aims to shrink that drastically. An additional $1 million will go to the teams that (per the rules) “successfully demonstrate accurate, precise, and rapid detection.”</p><p><a href=\"https://fpe.umd.edu/clark/faculty/601/Arnaud-Trouv%C3%A9\" target=\"_blank\">Arnaud Trouvé</a>, chair of the UMD’s Fire Protection Engineering department, thinks even the 10-minute limit may not be good enough. “On a <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/mqt/redflagtips\" target=\"_blank\">red flag</a> day with high-wind conditions, a fire that starts is going to be taking a big size within a matter of tens of seconds,” he said as we waited for the Alta X to try again. “So even the 10 minutes you have to go do something will be too slow.” Whatever comes from the XPrize, he says, will be adopted, but more likely in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00141-z\" target=\"_blank\">developed areas</a>, where fires spread more slowly and could be extinguished early on, when firefighters are often busy evacuating residents.</p><p>In any event, the time limit pointed most teams—and all the teams to make the semifinals—toward drones. Firefighters have worked, or tried to work, given bureaucratic and other hurdles, with drones for years, but mainly for reconnaissance, says <a href=\"https://wfca.com/staff/bob-roper/\" target=\"_blank\">Bob Roper</a>, a senior wildfire advisor for the <a href=\"https://wfca.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Western Fire Chiefs Association</a>. Many of the hurdles around using drones have been cleared, but no drone exists yet that can carry enough suppressant to be useful on its own, says Roper.

Roper says government-funded fire agencies seldom “have available unrestricted dollars to be able to develop something that’s new.” By sprinkling startups and universities with research funding, the XPrize is poised to make, he says, “a quantum leap difference.”</p><h2>Team Crossfire </h2><p>Word of the XPrize wildfire competition reached Trouvé’s desk soon after it launched in April 2023. He joined forces with colleagues in aerospace and mechanical engineering and with <a href=\"https://www.xfoundry.org/\" target=\"_blank\">xFoundry</a>, a new organization that uses competitions to spur entrepreneurship. (xFoundry’s founder, <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/people/amir-ansari\" target=\"_blank\">Amir Ansari</a>, happened to be one of the sponsors of the first XPrize in 1994; his sister-in-law <a href=\"https://www.xprize.org/people/anousheh-ansari\" target=\"_blank\">Anousheh</a> is the CEO of the XPrize Foundation.)

Like all the technology Crossfire has deployed, the scout was an <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-dji-phantom-drone\" target=\"_self\">off-the-shelf model</a>, made by the Chinese manufacturer <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-consumer-electronics-hall-of-fame-dji-phantom-drone\" target=\"_self\">DJI</a>. It came with a lot of important features already programmed in, including obstacle avoidance and lidar, and cost just $25,000, according to xFoundry head of products and ventures <a href=\"https://www.xfoundry.org/speakers/phillip-alvarez\" target=\"_blank\">Phillip Alvarez</a>. “We get a really nice, well-polished system for a pretty low price here, and then we can spend the rest of development on solving the hard stuff,” he said. In total, Crossfire has spent around $300,000, most of it raised from UMD donors, he added.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Person in a brown jacket and cap stands next to a large drone outdoors near a brick building.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"3bfa5\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/person-in-a-brown-jacket-and-cap-stands-next-to-a-large-drone-outdoors-near-a-brick-building.jpg?id=62599497&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">xFoundry’s Philip Alvarez stands behind the Crossfire team’s drone that’s used for detecting wildfires. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p><p>The hard stuff, some of it anyway, was visible on a large display monitor showing the feeds from the drone’s two cameras. On the right was the infrared feed; on it, a red square labeled “fire” bracketed the burning pallets. A smaller red fire square appeared up and to the right of this; this was a pile of glowing embers in a bin not far away. These were meant to represent a campfire—the contest rules required systems to distinguish between potentially destructive conflagrations and “decoy fires” that don’t pose a threat. Crossfire’s system made those distinctions based on the drone’s color video feed. That feed runs through an open-source <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-deep-learning\" target=\"_self\">deep learning model</a> known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Only_Look_Once\" target=\"_blank\">YOLO (“You Only Look Once”)</a>, which recognizes images.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A computer screen shows two aerial images and a red warning that reads \\u201cFire Detected\\u201d. \" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"d3029\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-computer-screen-shows-two-aerial-images-and-a-red-warning-that-reads-u201cfire-detected-u201d.jpg?id=62601830&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">One of Crossfire’s drones scans the terrain and distinguishes between a burning pile of pallets and a small fire in a bin. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Robb Mandelbaum </small></p><p>To train it, UMD students fed 40,000 photographs of fires to the model—manually identifying the blazes in about 1,200 of these. The result was that when the program processed the color feed from the drone, it concluded that pallets were a fire, marked on the screen in a blue box, and ignored the bin. Now both camera feeds indicated a blaze in the same place, and the monitor threw up a warning in red: “FIRE DETECTED.” As turkey vultures looked on from high above, the drone identified the fire again from a higher altitude, then with the cameras pointed at a different angle, it finally flew a preprogrammed back-and-forth route through the air that looks like a lawnmower’s path.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"People surround a white pickup truck that has it\\u2019s front hood open in the top image.

In the field, it will also process feeds from cameras mounted on poles throughout the forest—an early detection system that will trigger the scouting drone. This was designed by Alvarez, who happens to have a Ph.D. in biophysics, using an even newer version of image-reading AI developed just last year.</p><p>All of the teams, Santy says, have proposed something broadly similar: sensors and cameras on the ground or on one or more drones, or both, and AI interpreting the data. How teams get to the fire has been driven by regulation—the <a href=\"https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/atpubs/aim_html/chap11_section_3.html\" target=\"_blank\">FAA has restrictions on drones weighing more than</a> 25 kilograms (55 pounds), as well as autonomous systems dropping payloads, which is why Rivas had to pilot the Alta X. “Some are looking at how we can address the problem within the current regulations, so they’re trying to stay within the 55 pounds,” says Santy. Others are designing systems that ultimately could be deployed only under new regulations. That primarily comes down to either using a swarm of smaller drones or one heavy-lift drone. Teams that fly heavy in the finals will have to get FAA approval for the contest, just as Crossfire would need it to operate the Alta X autonomously.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A black quadcopter drone flies with a red balloon beneath it.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"b225c\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-black-quadcopter-drone-flies-with-a-red-balloon-beneath-it.jpg?id=62601815&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Crossfire’s fire-suppression drone flies toward a fire carrying a balloon full of water. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p><p>Curiously, the XPrize appears not to have spurred much innovation in actually putting out a fire. Most teams are using water, though they’re dropping it in a variety of different ways. It’s a work in progress, says Santy. “Teams have been thinking very hard about what works under challenging conditions” like wind, drone movement, and proximity to the fire.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image rm-float-left rm-resized-container rm-resized-container-25\" style=\"float: left;\"> <img alt=\"A woman sits behind a large drone.

Typically, aircraft flying at high altitude release a lot of water, which, says Trouvé, mostly misses the burning biomass. “Releasing the water at low elevations and directly above the burning biomass requires much less water,” he says.</p><p>With a new balloon installed on the Alta X, the team attempted to attack the fire a second time. This time, Rivas spent several minutes maneuvering the drone to get it in place before dropping the balloon, which appeared to partially detonate, spewing water as it fell. The balloon didn’t completely burst until it hit the platform, spraying water all over and creating a huge puff of steam. But when the smoke cleared, the fire still burned. Crossfire’s detonators, it turned out, were rated for warmer weather than this October day. “We’ve tested this probably 20 different times, and 20 different times it’s been successful,” Alvarez said ruefully.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\"> <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" style=\"display: block; padding-top: 56.25%;\"></span> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Crossfire’s drone carries a water balloon skyward, finds the fire, and drops the balloon.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Jayme Thornton</small></p><p>But the third attempt, several hours later, was the charm. Rivas whisked the Alta X over the fire. Taha, on the other side of the fire, checked its position and motioned for release. The balloon exploded a few meters below the drone, and a shower of water blanketed the fire. The thermal camera on the observation drone confirmed the fire had been extinguished. Muted “yays” and a smattering of applause broke out.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Four young men in the foreground and woman in the background stand in a parking lot.

Along with Taha, aerospace engineering professor <a href=\"https://aero.umd.edu/clark/faculty/58/Derek-A-Paley\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Paley</a> has talked to some 40 potential customers—mainly fire departments and government agencies—for the system Crossfire is developing. He’s currently uncertain whether there are enough organizations willing to adopt the technology to make it commercially viable. So far, he says, “it’s a little bit of an uphill battle, but we’re hoping with the visibility brought to the problem by XPrize” and the momentum of being a finalist—and, better still, some prize money in hand—“we’ll have enough to have a compelling business model.”</p><p>Roper, of the Western Fire Chiefs Association, acknowledges that “political considerations” around existing fleets of crewed aircraft will challenge the transition to drones, but he says that these can gain a foothold by operating when and where crewed aircraft can’t, at night, for example. Still, it will take multiple companies commercializing the technology to prod fire departments to purchase drones. Even then, he says, “it’s probably going to have to be adopted either at the federal or the state level first and then there’s a trickle-down effect to the local fire departments.”</p><p>If not, Paley says, “our tech is applicable to law enforcement, and other aspects of public safety. It’s just a question of, are we starting a wildfire company, or are we starting a robotics company.” <span class=\"ieee-end-mark\"></span></p>",

And iRobot was at a point where it needed a new strategy to keep ahead of lower-cost (and increasingly innovative) home robots from China.</p><p>Some folks were skeptical of this acquisition, and admittedly, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/amazon-irobot-acquisition\" target=\"_self\">I was one of them</a>. My primary worry was that iRobot would get swallowed up and effectively cease to exist, which tends to happen with acquisitions like these, but regulators in the United States had much more pointed concerns: namely, that Amazon would <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-jones-lawmakers-call-on-ftc-to-oppose-amazons-proposed-165-billion-acquisition-of-irobot\" target=\"_blank\">leverage its marketplace power to restrict competition</a>. The European Commission <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_5990\" target=\"_blank\">expressed similar objections</a>.</p><p>By late January 2024, <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/irobot-amazon\" target=\"_self\">the deal had fallen through</a>, iRobot laid off a third of its staff, suspended research and development, and CEO and cofounder <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinangle/\" target=\"_blank\">Colin Angle</a> left the company. Since then, iRobot has seemed resigned to its fate, coasting along on a few lackluster product announcements and not much else, and so Sunday’s announcement of bankruptcy was a surprise to no one—perhaps least of all to Angle.</p><h2>iRobot’s Bankruptcy and Amazon Deal Collapse</h2><p>“iRobot’s bankruptcy filing was really just a public-facing outcome of the tragedy that happened a year and a half ago,” Angle told <em>IEEE Spectrum</em> on Monday. “Today sucks, but I’ve already mourned. I mourned when the deal with Amazon got blocked for all the wrong reasons.” Angle points out that by the early 2020s, iRobot was no longer monopolizing the robot-vacuum market. This was especially true in Europe, where iRobot’s market share was 12 percent and decreasing. But from Angle’s perspective, regulators were more focused on making a point about Big Tech than they were about the actual merits and risks of the merger. </p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"A suited man with short blonde hair and glasses holds a round black robot vacuum in a hallway covered in patents.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"5ec16\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-suited-man-with-short-blonde-hair-and-glasses-holds-a-round-black-robot-vacuum-in-a-hallway-covered-in-patents.jpg?id=62593550&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Cofounder Colin Angle says that iRobot’s bankruptcy filing was unsurprising after a failed acquisition by Amazon a year and a half ago.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Charles Krupa/AP</small></p><p>“We were roadkilled in a larger agenda,” Angle says. “And this kind of regulation is incredibly destructive to the innovation economy. The whole concept of starting a tech company and having it acquired by a bigger tech company is far and away the most common positive outcome. For that to be taken away is not a good thing.” And for iRobot, it was fatal. </p><p>A <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268854\" target=\"_blank\">common criticism</a> of iRobot even before the attempted Amazon merger is that the company was simply being out-innovated in the robot-vacuum space, and Angle doesn’t necessarily disagree. “By 2020, China had become the largest market in the world for robot vacuums, and Chinese robotics companies with government support were investing two or three times as much as iRobot was in R&amp;D. We simply didn’t have the capital to move as quickly as we wanted to. In order for iRobot to continue to innovate and lead the industry, we needed to do so as part of a larger entity, and Amazon was very aligned with our vision for the home.”</p><p>This situation is not unique to iRobot, and there is <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-quadruped-robot-arm\" target=\"_blank\">significant concern in robotics</a><strong> </strong>about how companies can effectively compete against the massive advantage that China has in the production of low-cost hardware. In some sense, what happened to iRobot is an early symptom of what Angle (<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-quadruped-robot-arm\" target=\"_self\">and others</a>) see as a fundamental problem with robotics in the United States: lack of government support. In China, <a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/11/embodied-ai-china-smart-robots\" target=\"_blank\">long-term government support for robotics and embodied AI</a> (in the form of both policy and direct investment) can be found across industry and academia, something that neither the United States nor the European Union has been able to match. <span>“Robotics is in a global competition against some very fearsome competitors,” Angle says.</span><span> “</span><span>We have to decide whether we want to support our innovation economy. And if the answer is no, then the innovation economy g</span><span>oes elsewhere.”</span></p><p>The consequence of companies like iRobot losing this competition can be more than just bankruptcy. In iRobot’s case, a Chinese company now owns iRobot’s intellectual property and app infrastructure, which gives it access to data from millions of highly sensorized autonomous mobile robots in homes across the world. I asked Angle whether or not Roomba owners should be concerned about this. “When I was running the company, we talked a lot about this, and put a lot of effort into privacy and security,” he says. “This was fundamental to Roomba’s design. Now, I can’t speak to what they’ll prioritize.”</p><p>While Angle has moved on from iRobot, and has since cofounded a more-mysterious-than-we’d-like company called <a href=\"https://www.familiarmachines.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Familiar Machines and Magic</a>, he still feels strongly that what has happened to iRobot should be a warning to both robotics companies and policymakers. “Make no mistake: China is good at robots. So we need to play this hard. There’s a lot to learn from what we did at iRobot, and a lot of ways to do it better.”</p>On a personal note, I’m choosing to remember the iRobot that was—not just the company that <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/irobot-roomba-history\" target=\"_self\">built a robot vacuum out of nothing</a> and conquered the world with it for nearly two decades, but also the company that built the <a href=\"https://robotsguide.com/robots/packbot\" target=\"_blank\">PackBot</a> to save lives, as well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUd1miyCn5I\" target=\"_blank\">all of these other crazy robots</a>. I’m not sure there’s ever been a company quite like iRobot, and there may never be again. It will be missed.",

Ghost, a company that originated at the <a href=\"https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">GRASP Lab at the University of Pennsylvania</a>, specializes in exceptionally rugged quadrupeds, and while many of its customers use its robots for public safety and disaster relief, it also <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/274841/promising_experiment_signals_future_integration_of_advanced_tech_into_army_units\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">provides robots</a> to the U.S. military, which has very specific needs when it comes to keeping humans out of danger.</p><p>In that context, it’s not unreasonable to assume that Ghost’s robots may sometimes be used to carry weapons, and despite the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-killer-drones\" target=\"_self\">proliferation of robots</a> in many roles in the Ukraine war, the idea of a legged robot carrying a weapon is not a comfortable one for many people. <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> spoke with Ghost co-founder and current CEO <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/gavin-kenneally-321a3833/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gavin Kenneally</a> to learn more about the new arm, and to get his perspective on selling robots to the military.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Green military robot dog opens a wooden door with articulated arm.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"a501b\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/green-military-robot-dog-opens-a-wooden-door-with-articulated-arm.jpg?id=62304622&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Vision 60’s new arm has six degrees of freedom. </small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ghost Robotics</small></p><h2>Robots for the Military</h2><p>Ghost Robotics initially made a name for itself with its very impressive <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-minitaur-quadruped\" target=\"_self\">early work with the Minitaur direct-drive quadruped</a> in 2016. The company also made headlines in late 2021, when a now-deleted post on Twitter (now X) went viral because it included a photograph of one of Ghost’s Vision 60 quadrupeds <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ghost-robotics-armed-military-robots\" target=\"_self\">with a rifle mounted on its back</a>.</p><p>That picture resulted in a <a href=\"https://kodlab.seas.upenn.edu/news/koditscheks-letter-to-ghosts-ceo/\" target=\"_blank\">very strong reaction</a>, although as <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em> reported at the time, robots with guns affixed to them wasn’t new: To mention one early example, the U.S. military had already deployed weapons on mobile robots <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2008/04/armed-robots-st/\" target=\"_blank\">in Iraq in 2007</a>. And while several legged robot companies <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-with-weapons-industry-initiative\" target=\"_self\">pledged in 2022 not to weaponize their general-purpose robots</a>, the Chinese military <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/article/2024/may/30/chinese-armys-latest-weapon-gun-toting-dog\" target=\"_blank\">in 2024 displayed</a> quadrupeds from Unitree equipped with guns. (Unitree, based in China, was one of the signers of the 2022 pledge.)</p><p>The issue of weaponized robots goes far beyond Ghost Robotics, and far beyond robots with legs. We’ve covered both the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/we-should-not-ban-killer-robots\" target=\"_self\">practical</a> and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-path-towards-reasonable-autonomous-weapons-regulation\" target=\"_self\">ethical</a> perspectives on this extensively at <em><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></em>, and the intensity of the debates shows that there is no easy answer. But to summarize one important point made by some ethicists, some military experts, and Ghost Robotics itself: Robots are replaceable; humans are not. “Customers use our robots to keep people out of harm’s way,” Kenneally tells <em><em>Spectrum.</em></em></p><p>It’s also worth pointing out that even the companies who signed the pledge not to weaponize their general-purpose robots <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/robots-with-weapons-industry-initiative\" target=\"_self\">acknowledge</a> that military robots exist, and are accepting of that, provided that such robots are used under existing legal doctrines and operate within those safeguards—and that what constraints should or should not be imposed on these kinds of robots is best decided by policymakers rather than industry.</p><p>This is essentially Ghost Robotics’ position as well, says Kenneally. “We sell our robots to U.S. and allied governments, and as part of that, the robots are used in defense applications where they will sometimes be weaponized. What’s most critical to us is that the decisions about how to use these robots are happening systematically and ethically at the government policy level.”</p><p>To some extent, these decisions are already being made within the U.S. government. <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2023/Jan/25/2003149928/-1/-1/0/DOD-DIRECTIVE-3000.09-AUTONOMY-IN-WEAPON-SYSTEMS.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">Department of Defense Directive 3000.09</a>, “Autonomy in Weapon Systems,” lays out the responsibilities and limitations for how autonomous or human-directed robotics weapons systems should be developed and deployed, including requirements for human use-of-force judgments. At least in the United States, this directive implies that there are rules and accountability for robotic weapons.</p><p></p><h2>Vision 60’s Versatile Arm Capabilities</h2><p>Ghost sees its Vision 60 quadruped as a system that its trusted customers can use as they see fit, and the manipulator enables many additional capabilities. “The primary purpose of the robot has been as a sensor platform,” Kenneally says, “but sometimes there are doors in the way, or objects that need to be moved, or you might want the robot to take a sample. So the ability to do all of that mobile manipulation has been hugely valuable for our customers.”</p><p>As it turns out, arms are good for more than manipulation. “One thing that’s been very interesting is that our customers have been using the arm as a sensor boom, which is something that we hadn’t anticipated,” says Kenneally. Ghost’s robot has plenty of cameras, but they’re mostly at the viewpoint of a moderately sized dog. The new arm offers a more humanlike vantage and a way to peek around corners or over things without exposing the whole robot.</p><p>Ghost was not particularly interested in building its own arm and tried off-the-shelf options to get the manipulation bit working. And they did get the manipulation working; what didn’t work were any of those arms after the 50 kilogram robot rolled over on them. “We wanted to make sure that we could build an arm that could stand up to the same intense rigors of our customers’ operations that the rest of the robot can,” says Kenneally. “Morphologically, we actually consider the arm to be a fifth leg, so that the robot operates as a unified system for whole-body control.”</p><p>The rest of the robot is exceptionally rugged, which is what makes it appealing to customers with unique needs, like special forces teams. Enough battery life for more than three hours of walking (or more than 20 hours on standby) isn’t bad, and the Vision 60 is sealed against sand and dust, and can survive complete submergence in shallow water. It can operate in extreme temperatures ranging from -40 °C to 55 °C, which has been a particular challenge for robots. And if you do manage to put it in a situation where it physically breaks one of its legs, it’s easy to swap in a spare in just a few minutes, even out in the field.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Robotic dog opening a glass door with its arm in front of a building.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"724f7\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/robotic-dog-opening-a-glass-door-with-its-arm-in-front-of-a-building.jpg?id=62304623&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">The Vision 60 can open doors with high-level direction from a human operator.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\">Ghost Robotics</small></p><h2>Quadruped Robot Competition From China</h2><p>Despite Ghost quietly selling over a thousand quadrupeds to date, Kenneally is cautious about the near future for legged robots, as is anyone who has seriously considered buying one, because it’s impossible to ignore the option of just buying one from a Chinese company at about a tenth the cost of a quadruped from a company based in the U.S. or Europe.</p><p>“China has identified legged robotics as a linchpin technology that they are strategically funding,” Kenneally says. “I think it’s an extremely serious threat in the long term, and we have to take these competitors very seriously despite their current shortcomings.” There is a technological moat, for now, but if the market for legged robots follows the same trajectory as the market for drones did, that moat will shrink drastically over the next few years.</p><p>The United States is poised to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/chinese-dronemaker-dji-urges-us-complete-security-review-2025-12-04/\" target=\"_blank\">ban consumer drone sales from Chinese manufacturer DJI</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2017/08/us-army-just-ordered-soldiers-stop-using-drones-chinas-dji/139999/\" target=\"_blank\">banned DJI drone use by federal agencies in 2017</a>. But it may be too late in some sense, as DJI’s global market share is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/06/26/1094249/china-commercial-drone-dji-security/\" target=\"_blank\">something like 90 percent</a>. Meanwhile, Unitree may have already cornered <a href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/quadruped-state-of-the-market-unitree\" target=\"_blank\">somewhere around 70 percent</a> of the global market for quadrupeds, despite <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/unitree-robot-exploit\" target=\"_self\">the recent publication of exploits</a> that allow the robots to send unauthorized data to China.</p><p>In the United States, in particular, private-sector robotics funding is unpredictable at the best of times, and Kenneally argues that to compete with Chinese-subsidized robot-makers, American companies like Ghost, which produce these robots domestically, will need sustained U.S. government support, too. That doesn’t mean the government has to pick which companies will be the winners, but that it should find a way to support the U.S. robotics industry as a whole if it still wants to have a meaningful one. “The quadruped industry isn’t a science project anymore,” says Kenneally. “It’s matured, and quadruped robots are going to become extremely important in both commercial and government applications. But it’s only through continued innovation that we’ll be able to stay ahead.”</p>",

The two goals have fueled her journey from a childhood living under a dictatorship in Romania to the forefront of global robotics research.</p><p>Rus, who is director of<a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> MIT</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a> (CSAIL), is the recipient of this year’s<a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-edison-medal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Edison Medal</a>, which recognizes her for “sustained leadership and pioneering contributions in modern robotics.”</p><p>An IEEE Fellow, she describes the recognition as a responsibility to further her work and mentor the next generation of roboticists entering the field.</p><p>The Edison Medal is the latest in a string of honors she has received. In 2017 she won an<a href=\"https://www.automate.org/robotics/engelberger/joseph-f-engelberger-awards\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Engelberger Robotics Award</a> from the<a href=\"https://www.automate.org/companies/robotic-industries-association\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Robotic Industries Association</a>. The following year, she was honored with the<a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/awards-recognition/society-awards?view=article&amp;id=55:ras-pioneer-award&amp;catid=69:society-awards\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Pioneer in Robotics and Automation Award</a> by the<a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Robotics and Automation Society</a>. The society recognized her again in 2023 with its<a href=\"https://www.ieee-ras.org/awards-recognition/ieee-awards?view=article&amp;id=92:ieee-robotics-and-automation-technical-field-award-tfa&amp;catid=69:society-awards\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> IEEE Robotics and Automation Technical Field Award</a>.</p><h2>From Romania to Iowa </h2><p>Rus was born in<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Cluj-Napoca-Romania\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Cluj-Napoca, Romania</a>, during the rule of dictator<a href=\"https://www.cato.org/commentary/rise-fall-nicolae-ceausescu-romanian-fuehrer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Nicolae Ceausescu</a>. Her early life unfolded in a world defined by scarcity—rationed food, intermittent electricity, and a limited ability to move up or out. But she recalls that, amid the stifling insufficiencies, she was surrounded by an irrepressible warmth and intellectual curiosity—even when she was making locomotive screws in a state-run factory as part of her school’s curriculum.</p><p>“Life was hard,” she says, “but we had great teachers and strong communities. As a child, you adapt to whatever is around you.”</p><p>Her father,<a href=\"https://cs.uiowa.edu/people/teodor-rus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Teodor</a>, was a computer scientist and professor, and her mother, Elena, was a physicist.</p><p>In 1982, when she was 19, Rus’s father emigrated to the United States to join the faculty at the<a href=\"https://uiowa.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> University of Iowa</a>, in Iowa City. It was an act of courage and conviction. Within a year, Daniela and her mother joined him there.</p><p>“He wanted the freedom to think, to publish, to explore ideas,” Rus says. “And I reaped the benefits of being free from the limitations of our homeland.”</p><p>America’s open horizons were intoxicating, she says.</p><h2>A lecture that changed everything</h2><p>Rus decided to pursue a degree at her father’s university, where her life changed direction, she says. One afternoon, <a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/hopcroft_1053917.cfm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John Hopcroft</a>—a<a href=\"https://amturing.acm.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Turing Award</a>–winning <a href=\"https://www.cornell.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cornell</a> computer scientist renowned for his work on algorithms and data structures—gave a talk on campus. His message was simple but electrifying, Rus says: Classical computer science had been solved. The next frontier, Hopcroft declared, was computations that interact with the messy physical world.</p><p>For Rus, the idea was a revelation.</p><p>“It was as if a door had opened,” she says. “I realized the future of computing wasn’t just about logic and code; it was about how machines can perceive, move, and help us in the real world.”</p><p>After the lecture, she introduced herself to Hopcroft and told him she wanted to learn from him. Not long after earning her bachelor’s degree in computer science and mathematics in 1985, she applied to get a master’s degree at Cornell, where Hopcroft became her graduate advisor. Rus developed algorithms there for dexterous <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/minimally-actuated-robot-arm-has-lots-of-joints-just-one-clever-motor\" target=\"_self\">robotic manipulation</a>—teaching machines to grasp and move objects with precision. She earned her master’s in computer science in 1990, then stayed on at Cornell to work toward a doctorate.</p><p class=\"pull-quote\">“I like to think of robotics as a way to give people superpowers. Machines can help us reach farther, think faster, and live fuller lives.”</p><p>In 1993 she earned her Ph.D. in computer science, then took a position as an assistant professor of computer science at <a href=\"https://home.dartmouth.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Dartmouth College</a>, in Hanover, N.H. She founded the college’s robotics laboratory and expanded her work into distributed robotics. She developed teams of small robots that cooperated to perform tasks such as ensuring products in warehouses are correctly gathered to fulfill orders, get packaged safely, and are routed to their respective destinations efficiently.</p><p>Despite a lack of traditional machine shop facilities for fabrication on the Hanover campus, Rus found a way. She pioneered the use of<a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/printable-robots-mit-project\" target=\"_self\"> 3D printing to rapidly prototype and build robots</a>.</p><p>In 2003 she left Dartmouth to become a professor in the<a href=\"https://www.eecs.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> electrical engineering and computer science</a> department at <a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">MIT</a>.</p><p>The robotics lab she created at Dartmouth moved with her to MIT and became known as the <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/distributed-robotics-laboratory\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Distributed Robotics Laboratory</a> (DRL). In 2012 she was named director of MIT’s<a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>, the school’s largest interdisciplinary lab, with 60 research groups including the DRL. She also continues to serve as the DRL’s principal investigator.</p><h2>The science of physical intelligence</h2><p>Rus now leads pioneering research at the intersection of AI and robotics, a field she calls <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">physical intelligence</a>. It’s “a new form of intelligent machine that can understand dynamic environments, cope with unpredictability, and make decisions in real time,” <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/news-clip/wired-451\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">she says</a>.</p><p>Her lab builds <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-robots-for-hard-problems\" target=\"_self\">soft-body robots inspired by nature</a> that can sense, adapt, and learn. They are AI-driven systems that passively handle tasks—such as self-balancing and complex articulation similar to that done by the human hand—because their shape and materials minimize the need for heavy processing.</p><p>Such machines, she says, someday will be able to navigate different environments, perform useful functions without external control, and even recover from disturbances to their route planning. Researchers also are exploring ways to make them more energy-efficient.</p><p>One prototype developed by Rus’s team is designed to retrieve foreign objects from the body, including batteries swallowed by children. The ingestible robots are artfully folded, similar to origami, so they are small enough to be swallowed. Embedded magnetic materials allow doctors to steer the soft robots and control their shape. Upon arriving in the stomach, a soft bot can be programmed to wrap around a foreign object and guide it safely out of the patient’s body.</p><p>CSAIL researchers also are working on small robots that can carry a medication and release it at a specific area within the digestive tract, bypassing the stomach acid known to diminish some drugs’ efficacy. Ingestible robots also could patch up internal injuries or ulcers. And because they’re made from digestible materials such as sausage casings and biocompatible polymers, the robots can perform their assigned tasks and then get safely absorbed by the body, she says.</p><p>Health care isn’t the only application on the horizon for such AI-driven technologies. Robots with physical intelligence might someday help firefighters locate people trapped in burning buildings, find miners after a cave-in, and provide valuable situational awareness information to emergency response teams in the aftermath of natural disasters, Rus says.</p><p>“What excites me is the possibility of giving people new powers,” she says. “Machines that can think and move safely in the physical world will let us extend human reach—at work, at home, in medicine … everywhere.”</p><p>To make such a vision a reality, she has expanded her technical interests to include several complementary lines of research.</p><p>She’s working on self-reconfiguring and <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/stochastic-robots-assemble-and-disassemble-themselves\" target=\"_self\">modular robots</a> such as MIT’s <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/m-blocks-modular-robotics\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">M-Blocks</a> and NASA’s <a href=\"https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/what-we-do/research-tasks/superbot-modular-multifunctional-reconfigurable-robot/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SuperBots</a>, which can attach, detach, and rearrange themselves to form shapes suited for different actions such as slithering, climbing, and crawling.</p><p>With <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/nyu-tandon-robotics\" target=\"_self\">networked robots</a>—including those <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/?tag=amazusnavi-20&amp;hvadid=675149237887&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=13161685782168516493&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9004281&amp;hvtargid=kwd-10573980&amp;ref=pd_sl_7j18redljs_e&amp;hydadcr=28883_14649097\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> uses in its warehouses—thousands of machines can operate as a large adaptive system. The machines communicate continuously to divide tasks, avoid collisions, and optimize package routing.</p><p>Rus’s team also is making advances in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/human-robot-interaction\" target=\"_self\">human-robot interaction</a>, such as reading brainwave activity and <a href=\"https://www.josephdelpreto.com/portfolio/detect-sign-language-with-a-smart-glove/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">interpreting sign language through a smart glove</a>.</p><p>To further her plan of putting all the computerized smarts the robots need within their physical bodies instead of in the cloud, she helped found <a href=\"https://www.liquid.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid AI</a> in 2023. The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., develops <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/liquid-neural-networks\" target=\"_self\">liquid neural networks</a>, inspired by the simple brains of worms, that can learn and adapt continuously. The word <em><em>liquid</em></em> in this case refers to the adaptability, flexibility, and dynamic nature of the team’s model architecture. It can change shape and adapt to new data inputs, and it fits within constraints imposed by the hardware in which it’s contained, she says.</p><h2>Finding community in IEEE</h2><p>Rus joined IEEE at one of its robotics conferences when she was a graduate student.</p><p>“I think I signed up just to get the student discount,” she says with a laugh. “But IEEE turned out to be the place where my community lived.”</p><p>She credits the organization’s conferences, journals, and collaborative spirit with shaping her professional growth.</p><p>“The exchange of ideas, the chance to test your thinking against others—it’s invaluable,” she says. “It’s how our field moves forward.”</p><p>Rus continues to serve on IEEE panels and committees, mentoring the next generation of roboticists.</p><p>“IEEE gave me a platform,” Rus says. “It taught me how to communicate, how to lead, and how to dream bigger.”</p><h2>Living the American dream</h2><p>Looking back, Rus sees her story as a testament to unforeseen possibilities.</p><p>“When I was growing up in Romania, I couldn’t even imagine living in America,” she says. “Now I’m here, working with brilliant students, building robots that help people, and trying to make a difference. I feel like I’m living the American dream.”</p><p>In a nod to a memorable song from the Broadway musical <a href=\"https://hamiltonmusical.com/new-york/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em><em>Hamilton</em></em></a>, Rus echoes <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/alexander-hamilton.htm\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Alexander Hamilton</a>’s determination to make the most of his opportunities, saying, “I don’t ever want to throw away my shot.”</p>",

While working on assembly lines at an automotive parts supplier in 2015, he got a surprise call from his high-school science teacher that set him off on an entirely new path: piloting underwater robots to explore <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/underwater-robotics\" target=\"_self\">the ocean’s deepest abysses</a>.</p><p>That call came from <a href=\"https://nthf.org/inductees/harlan-kredit/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Harlan Kredit</a>, a nationally renowned science teacher and board member of a Rhode Island-based nonprofit called the <a href=\"https://www.engineeringfordiscovery.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Global Foundation for Ocean Exploration</a> (GFOE). The organization was looking for an electrical engineer to help design, build, and pilot remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) for the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.noaa.gov/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>.</p><h3>Levi Unema</h3><br /><p><strong></strong><strong>Employer</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Deep Exploration Solutions</p><p><strong>Occupation</strong></p><p><strong></strong>ROV engineer</p><p><strong>Education </strong></p><p>Bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering, Michigan Technological University</p><p>This was an exciting break for Unema, a Washington state native who had grown up tinkering with electronics and exploring the outdoors. Unema joined the team in early 2016 and has since helped develop and operate deep-sea robots for scientific expeditions around the globe.</p><p>The GFOE’s contract with NOAA expired in July, forcing the engineering team to disband. But soon after, Unema teamed up with four former colleagues to start their own ROV consultancy, called <a href=\"https://deepexplorationsolutions.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deep Exploration Solutions</a>, to continue the work he’s so passionate about.</p><p>“I love the exploration and just seeing new things every day,” he says. “And the engineering challenges that go along with it are really exciting, because there’s a lot of pressure down there and a lot of technical problems to solve.”</p><h2>Nature and Technology</h2><p>Unema’s fascination with electronics started early. Growing up in Lynden, Wash., he took apart radios, modified headphones, and hacked together USB chargers from AA batteries. “I’ve always had to know how things work,” he says. He was also a Boy Scout, and much of his youth was spent hiking, camping, and snowboarding.</p><p>That love of both technology and nature can be traced back, at least in part, to his parents—his father was a civil engineer, and his mother was a high-school biology teacher. But another major influence growing up was Kredit, the science teacher who went on to recruit him. (Kredit was also a colleague of Unema’s mother.)</p><p>Kredit has won numerous awards for his work as an educator, including the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science Teaching in 2004. Like Unema, he also shares a love for the outdoors as Yellowstone National Park’s <a href=\"https://www.lyndentribune.com/news/50-years-at-yellowstone-harlan-kredit-is-suspected-longest-serving-ranger-in-park-s-history/article_0311911c-18b4-11ed-95b6-97025762a862.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">longest-serving park ranger</a>. “He was an excellent science teacher, very inspiring,” says Unema.</p><p>When Unema graduated high school in 2010, he decided to enroll at his father’s alma mater, <a href=\"https://www.mtu.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Michigan Technological University</a>, to study engineering. He was initially unsure what discipline to follow and signed up for the general engineering course, but he quickly settled on electrical engineering.</p><p>A summer internship at a steel mill run by the multinational corporation <a href=\"https://corporate.arcelormittal.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">ArcelorMittal</a> introduced Unema to factory automation and assembly lines. After graduating in 2014 he took a job at <a href=\"https://www.gentex.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gentex Corp.</a> in Zeeland, Mich., where he worked on manufacturing systems and industrial robotics.</p><h2>Diving Into Underwater Robotics</h2><p>In late 2015, he got the call from Kredit asking if he’d be interested in working on underwater robots for GFOE. The role involved not just engineering these systems, but also piloting them. Taking the plunge was a difficult choice, says Unema, as he’d just been promoted at Gentex. But the promise of travel combined with the novel engineering challenges made it too good an opportunity to turn down.</p><p>Building technology that can withstand the crushing pressure at the bottom of the ocean is tough, he says, and you have to make trade-offs between weight, size, and cost. Everything has to be waterproof, and electronics have to be carefully isolated to prevent them from grounding on the ocean floor. Some components are pressure-tolerant, but most must be stored in pressurized titanium flasks, so the components must be extremely small to minimize the size of the metallic housing.</p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\"> <img alt=\"Technicians operate complex control panels with multiple monitors in a dark, focused environment.\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" id=\"6cc31\" src=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/technicians-operate-complex-control-panels-with-multiple-monitors-in-a-dark-focused-environment.png?id=62218876&amp;width=980\" /> <small class=\"image-media media-caption\">Unema conducts predive checks from the Okeanos Explorer’s control room. Once the ROV is launched, scientists will watch the camera feeds and advise his team where to direct the vehicle.</small><small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\"><a href=\"https://www.art-work.global/high-seas\" target=\"_blank\">Art Howard</a></small></p><p>“You’re working very closely with the mechanical engineer to fit the electronics in a really small space,” he says. “The smaller the cylinder is, the cheaper it is, but also the less mass on the vehicle. Every bit of mass means more buoyancy is required, so you want to keep things small, keep things light.”</p><p><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/underwater-communication\" target=\"_self\">Communications</a> are another challenge. The ROVs rely on several kilometers of cable containing just three single-mode optical fibers. “All the communication needs to come together and then go up one cable,” Unema says. “And every year new instruments consume more data.”</p><p>He works exclusively on ROVs that are custom made for scientific research, which require smoother control and considerably more electronics and instrumentation than the heavier-duty vehicles used by the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-gulf-spills-lessons-for-robotics\" target=\"_self\">oil and gas</a> industry. “The science ones are all hand-built, they’re all quirky,” he says.</p><p>Unema’s role spans the full life cycle of an ROV’s design, construction, and operation. He primarily spends winters upgrading and maintaining vehicles and summers piloting them on expeditions. At GFOE, he mainly worked on two ROVs for NOAA called <em><em>Deep Discoverer</em></em> and <em><em>Seirios</em></em>, which operate from the ship <em><em>Okeanos Explorer</em></em>. But he has also piloted ROVs for other organizations over the years, including the <a href=\"https://schmidtocean.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Schmidt Ocean Institute</a> and the <a href=\"https://nautiluslive.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ocean Exploration Trust</a>.</p><p>Unema’s new consultancy, Deep Exploration Solutions, has been given a contract to do the winter maintenance on the NOAA ROVs, and the firm is now on the lookout for more ROV design and upgrade work, as well as piloting jobs.</p><h2>An Engineer’s Life at Sea</h2><p>On expeditions, Unema is responsible for driving the robot. He follows instructions from a science team that watches the ROV’s video feed to identify things like corals, sponges, or deepwater creatures that they’d like to investigate in more detail. Sometimes he will also operate hydraulic arms to sample particularly interesting finds.</p><p>In general, the missions are aimed at discovering new species and mapping the range of known ones, says Unema. “There’s a lot of the bottom of the ocean where we don’t know anything about it,” he says. “Basically every expedition there’s some new species.”</p><p>This involves being at sea for weeks at a time. Unema says that life aboard ships can be challenging—many new crew members get seasick, and you spend almost a month living in close quarters with people you’ve often never met before. But he enjoys the opportunity to meet colleagues from a wide variety of backgrounds who are all deeply enthusiastic about the mission.</p><p>“It’s like when you go to scout camp or summer camp,” he says. “You’re all meeting new people. Everyone’s really excited to be there. We don’t know what we’re going to find.”</p><p>Unema also relishes the challenge of solving engineering problems with the <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution\" target=\"_self\">limited resources available</a> on the ship. “We’re going out to the middle of the Pacific,” he says. “Things break, and you’ve got to fix them with what you have out there.”</p><p>If that sounds more exciting than daunting, and you’re interested in working with ROVs, Unema’s main advice is to talk to engineers in the field. It’s a small but friendly community, he says, so just do your research to see what opportunities are available. Some groups, such as the Ocean Exploration Trust, also operate internships for college students to help them get experience in the field.</p><p>And Unema says there are very few careers quite like it. “I love it because I get to do all aspects of engineering—from idea to operations,” he says. “To be able to take something I worked on and use it in the field is really rewarding.”</p><p><em>This article appears in the December 2025 print issue as “Levi Unema.”</em></p>",
